I&#x27;ll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.&quot;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror &quot;Frailty&quot;, with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played.&quot; I&#x27;m no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with &quot;Miracle&quot; and &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Carnivale&quot; and &quot;Rome&quot;), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour.

The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet&#x27;s parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son&#x27;s talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /…</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won&#x27;t be because it doesn&#x27;t deserve to. Before this film, I didn&#x27;t realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There&#x27;s something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.&quot;</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in &quot;Even Stevens&quot; this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise.

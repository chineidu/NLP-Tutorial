        "- However, in cases like `legal` or `scientific text`, domain-specific words may be treated as `rare` tokens.\n",
        "- Fine-tuning the language model on in-domain data can improve downstream task performance.\n",
        "- This process is called d`omain adaptation`, popularized by ULMFiT in 2018.\n",

        "- For both `auto-regressive` and `masked language modeling`, a common preprocessing step is to `concatenate` all the examples and then split the whole corpus into chunks of equal size.\n",
        "- This is quite different from our usual approach, where we simply tokenize individual examples. Why concatenate everything together?\n",
        "- The reason is that individual examples might get truncated if they’re too long, and that would result in losing information that might be useful for the language modeling task!\n",
        "\n",
        "- To get started, we’ll first tokenize our corpus as usual, but without setting the `truncation=True` option in our tokenizer.\n",
        "- We’ll also grab the word IDs if they are available (which they will be if we’re using a fast tokenizer, as described in Chapter 6), as we will need them later on to do whole word masking.\n",
        "- We’ll wrap this in a simple function, and while we’re at it we’ll remove the `text` and `label` columns since we don’t need them any longer:"

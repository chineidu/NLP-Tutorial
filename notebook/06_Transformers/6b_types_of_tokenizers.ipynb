    "### Training algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "- BPE training starts by computing the unique set of words used in the corpus (after the normalization and pre-tokenization steps are completed), then building the vocabulary by taking all the symbols used to write those words. \n",
    "- As a very simple example, let’s say our corpus uses these five words:\n",
    "  \"hug\", \"pug\", \"pun\", \"bun\", \"hugs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The base vocabulary will then be [\"b\", \"g\", \"h\", \"n\", \"p\", \"s\", \"u\"]. \n",
    "- For real-world cases, that base vocabulary will contain all the ASCII characters, at the very least, and probably some Unicode characters as well. \n",
    "- If an example you are tokenizing uses a character that is not in the training corpus, that character will be converted to the unknown token. \n",
    "- That’s one reason why lots of NLP models are very bad at analyzing content with emojis, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The GPT-2 and RoBERTa tokenizers (which are pretty similar) have a clever way to deal with this: they don’t look at words as being written with Unicode characters, but with bytes. \n",
    "- This way the base vocabulary has a small size (256), but every character you can think of will still be included and not end up being converted to the unknown token. \n",
    "- This trick is called byte-level BPE.\n",
    "- After getting this base vocabulary, we add new tokens until the desired vocabulary size is reached by learning merges, which are rules to merge two elements of the existing vocabulary together into a new one. \n",
    "- So, at the beginning these merges will create tokens with two characters, and then, as training progresses, longer subwords.\n",
    "- At any step during the tokenizer training, the BPE algorithm will search for the most frequent pair of existing tokens (by “pair,” here we mean two consecutive tokens in a word). \n",
    "- That most frequent pair is the one that will be merged, and we rinse and repeat for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Going back to our previous example, let’s assume the words had the following frequencies:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(\"hug\", 10), (\"pug\", 5), (\"pun\", 12), (\"bun\", 4), (\"hugs\", 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "meaning \"hug\" was present 10 times in the corpus, \"pug\" 5 times, \"pun\" 12 times, \"bun\" 4 times, and \"hugs\" 5 times. We start the training by splitting each word into characters (the ones that form our initial vocabulary) so we can see each word as a list of tokens:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(\"h\" \"u\" \"g\", 10), (\"p\" \"u\" \"g\", 5), (\"p\" \"u\" \"n\", 12), (\"b\" \"u\" \"n\", 4), (\"h\" \"u\" \"g\" \"s\", 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Then we look at pairs. The pair (\"h\", \"u\") is present in the words \"hug\" and \"hugs\", so 15 times total in the corpus. It’s not the most frequent pair, though: that honor belongs to (\"u\", \"g\"), which is present in \"hug\", \"pug\", and \"hugs\", for a grand total of 20 times in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first merge rule learned by the tokenizer is (\"u\", \"g\") -> \"ug\", which means that \"ug\" will be added to the vocabulary, and the pair should be merged in all the words of the corpus. At the end of this stage, the vocabulary and corpus look like this:\n",

But as the games passed the narrow style Marsch was trying to implement failed to produce consistent performances, attractive football or results.', '', 'Marsch, a likeable, well-travelled and educated man whose elaborate management speak could sometimes confuse supporters, who were increasingly failing to see theory in practice.', '', \"Like Bielsa he did have to cope with significant injuries to experienced players - Stuart Dallas, Patrick Bamford and Adam Forshaw in particular - and the inability to purchase an experienced left-back to compete with Junior Firpo, who struggled for form and fitness, seemed short-sighted on the club's part.\", '', 'There were glimpses of what might have been with a stunning 3-0 win over Chelsea in August.

After almost a year in charge it seemed beyond him to coach the squad to its potential, which by January included a record signing in Georginio Rutter, Austria defender Max Wober and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie on loan.', '', \"Ultimately, the club's place in the top flight, a huge investment and a pending takeover by minority shareholders San Francisco 49ers Enterprises from majority shareholder Andrea Radrizzani were all jeopardised.\", '', \"And so decisive action was taken following the defeat at Nottingham Forest.
